GBDD is a meta package for BDDs, providing one interface to several
BDD packages. It also provides an abstraction for representing relations
over BDD based structures, allowing the user to ignore the variables
allocated to each domain of the relation. 

Documentation can be found in the docs directory.

The homepage for GBDD can be found on http://www.regularmodelchecking.com.
